    "Early-career full stack AI developer passionate about Backend engineering and Infra for Next-Gen Agentic LLM Systems.",
  summary:
    "I’m a 21 year old software developer and a recent [CS + Applied Math](/work#education) graduate, building end-to-end robust AI driven workflows and platforms with a focus on reliability, scale, and impact. Previously worked across [Computer Vision and Full Stack systems.](/work) and have extensively built interdisciplinary projects which can be [viewed here](/work#projects). I'm an avid learner who likes [algorithmic problem solving](https://leetcode.com/u/tupac_x11/) and am heavily curious in learning about multi modal inference systems at scale. Currently seeking roles in AI, backend, or data engineering where I can own critical paths, move quickly with lean teams, and ship value. Founder‑curious and startup‑minded, I’m excited by zero‑to‑one challenges, building with small, high‑trust teams, and partnering closely with founders to take AI products from prototype to reliable, scalable systems. If that resonates, let’s connect.",
